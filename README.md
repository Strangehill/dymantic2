Remember, when checking out branches with different NPM packages, to
- remove node_nodules,
- stop the dev server,
- `yarn` (or `npm install`?) and
- `yarn start` (or..?)

to begin development server or `yarn start` (or `npm start`).
to deploy, thanks to the gh-pages npm package, run `npm run deploy` (or `yarn run deploy`) to publish
